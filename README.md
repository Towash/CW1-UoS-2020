ECS - Battle Arena
UoS Coursework for the Programming 1 module - 2020/2021

The aim of this coursework is to construct a simple simulation of a battle arena. This arena will admit students and they will form a team to battle different teams of monsters.

Note that this work has been released well after the deadline as to maintain academic intergrity.
